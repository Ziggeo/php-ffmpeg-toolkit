php-ffmpeg-toolkit
==================

A php library for running ffmpeg. It requires and is based on two other libraries that drive ffmpeg via php.
The purpose of this library is to provide a high-level easy-to-use interface to ffmpeg.

The two libraries being used are:
- https://github.com/alchemy-fr/PHP-FFmpeg
- http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-php

Although both libraries look similar, they don't perform the same tasks, so we really need both.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Clone the two other repositories.
3. Autoload the two other repositories.
4. Include the php files you need.
